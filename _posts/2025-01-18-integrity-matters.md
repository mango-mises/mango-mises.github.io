In my opinion distributed ledgers face three integrity problems:
1. Network integrity
2. Social integrity
3. Computational integrity

In this post I want to dump some thoughts revolving around these problems. In a subsequent post I want to dump thoughts on scalable ledger design.

### Network integrity

Network integrity is provided by consensus protocols. In my view, they transform common belief[^1] in some honest threshold of network nodes[^2] into common belief in consistency of views of the ledger by all observers. I think there is formal content to this viewpoint. For instance, in the oral message algorithm from the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/357172.357176) paper, it's cool to interpret a chain of messages (a path in each agent's local tree) as a sequence of belief operators. Disregarding introspections, this seems to lead to "practical" common belief.

Network integrity requires a large and cohesive network. The moral solution is thus a single consensus layer, without fragmentation and without duplicate efforts. Emphatically, the network comprising this layer consists not only of "operator" nodes, but also of "relayer" nodes that participate in P2P efforts and contribute to cohesion.

Such a vision quickly runs into a scaling question: Is there tension between security, performance, and network size?

#### DAGs

Causality relations are canonically structured as DAGs:
1. Events may be causally independent.[^3] These are path-disconnected nodes.
2. An event may causally depend on multiple independent events. This is a node with several parents.
3. Two events cannot causally depend on each other.

Let's fix a context. The details don't really matter yet, but in ours, events are blocks. Each view of the world has its own DAG, encoding known information. Since causality is absolute, all such DAGs are consistent in the sense that their superposition is a also a DAG, corresponding to the union of information from consituent views.  Note the stark contrast to possible of conflicting views of e.g. the longest/heaviest chain. In my opinion, such discrepancies hint that ordering must be founded on full information, i.e the entire ambient DAG as opposed to arbitrarily chosen substructures.

The canonical DAG structure of causality relations precludes any inherent tendency in favor of sequential monopolies. In our distributed ledger context, there's a very compelling argument _against_ sequential monopolies - they are hugely centralized by definition. In the next section we'll distill this principled intuition into strong arguments in favor of _wide DAGs_ for the sake of social integrity.

The fact _all_ events are naturally structured in a causality DAG inspires a separation between event revelation[^4] and event ordering. Revelation aims for each node to keep its view via local causality DAG. Ordering then converts this DAG into a chain. This yoga is far-reaching and Sybil-independent. In PoS it is beautifully exemplified e.g. by [Narwhal and Tusk](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11827) and [Mysticeti-C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821). In PoW it is incarnated in the masterpiece called [DAG-KNIGHT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1494.pdf) (and already in [GHOSTDAG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/104.pdf) before it). Let's dive in a little.

#### PoS quorums

Monolithic PoS quorum-based consensus protocols periodically gather many operators in a dedicated voting room[^5] until a quorum of stake is reached. Large quorums become bottlenecks due to communication overhead. Small quorums forgo security. These extremes are interpolated via randomly selected committees: small quorums are accumulated until a global stake threshold is reached, granting finality. [TODO: refer to Vitalik's discussion about committees]

Just to make the security point explicit:
* In monolithic PoS quorum-based protocols, a small quorum means consensus is secured by a small portion of stake.
* In PoW, consensus is secured by all of the hashrate[^6].

Such protocols feature a common fan-out â†’ fan-in pattern which obstructs their throughput by strongly coupling between dissemination of new transactions and consensus.
1. (Fan-out.) A block authored by Alice is propagated out throughout the network, where operators individually vote on it.
2. (Fan-in.) Individual votes are jointly consumed by appending (a hash of) a quorum to the next block.
3. Repeat.

Let's see how the revelation/ordering yoga resolves this obstruction. I have in mind two motivating principles: first is the puritanical idea that individual votes are events and should therefore appear explicitly in the event structure instead of being "meta-events"; second is the observation that monolithic voting is overloaded - it signifies both acknowledgement on information and also an opinion about ordering.

In monolithic protocols, individual voting events on a block causally depend only on the block. Naive voting is structured as a fan graph; subtler voting is still structured as a tree. Evidently, a chain structure excludes trees. Thus monolithic protocols _must_ defer voting to "meta-events". To continue, we draw inspiration from longest chain protocols, which are essentially [foot voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_voting). A naive first attempt is to generalize from a block-chain to a block-tree, and implicitly interpret each block as a foot vote for its parent. However, the resulting structure diverges due to fanout. But what exactly is happening here? First, these votes are acknowledgements of information and not votes on ordering. Second, the divergence stems from a glaring redundance: Alice should not propagate a block for each acknowledgement - she can batch her acknowledgements in a single block. Thus we arrive naturally at a block-DAG representing the causality relation between all blocks known to a given network view. This DAG accounts for information revelation, and is separate from ordering. Moreover, throughput has substantially increased thanks to removal of ordering from the critical path of block creation and dissemination.

It now remains to order the DAG into a chain of events. To this end there are various protocols. I'll mention [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05677) and [Mysticeti-C](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821).

I'm guessing (!) the DAG paradigm won't improve the _security_ of PoS quorum-based protocols because it hits the same underlying bottleneck, only now it's explicit as the maximal sustainable DAG width. Specifically, I'm guessing the width can't exceed several hundreds of blocks, which is similar to the Tendermint validator set bounds I've heard from the folks at Informal Systems.

#### PoW

In my opinion the field of PoW consensus is essentially complete with [DAG KNIGHT](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1494.pdf). This amazing paper is the culmination of an admirable intellectual journey going back at least as far as [2015](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf). I'm very lucky to have access to both Yoni and Sutton, and I'll try to write about DAG KNIGHT in the near future.

Interestingly, while Narwhal interprets the causality DAG as a mempool protocol, the word 'mempool' appears neither in DAG KNIGHT nor GHOSTDAG. If I understand correctly, Kaspa clients do include a mempool protocol that propagates transactions. In my opinion mempool protocols are interesting from an incentive viewpoint, as miners don't have an obvious reason for sharing profitable transactions. I also think interpretting the DAG as a mempool protocol can improve (what I understand of) Yoni's reverse auction idea. I'll write a bit more below.

### Social integrity

Social integrity generally means people are not assholes, but rather adhere to a common belief in some moral code. In our context, I want to "define" social integrity by paraphrasing a folklore quote[^7]:

> Integrity is doing the right thing, even if you can get away with the wrong thing.

Operators collectively control the ledger creation process: they can censor, delay, omit, inject, and order information & transactions. They may act to maximize their own utility at the possible expense of users, or of the truth. I think such "wrongdoing" falls in two classes:

1. (Oracles) Operators control introduction of external information into the ledger. They can e.g. lie about the weather or an exchange rate. The protocol is oblivious to external events and therefore cannot inherently judge validity.
2. (MEV) Operators may manipulate transactions. The protocol can impose limits on ordering[^8], but it is ultimately oblivious to even the simplest manipulations of censorship, injection, and delay.

With neither an oracle for truth nor an omniscient supervisor, we should draw inspiration from economics and specifically from market mechanism.[^9] Prices are not inherent properties of goods. Instead, they are discovered through markets, which facilitate the expression of individual preferences and integrate them into commonly believed "market prices". It makes sense to emulate such a mechanism in-protocol.

The market analogy highlights the drawbacks of sequential monopologies (chains) compared to DAGs. In a nutshell, a market with a single daily-varying stall is inferior to a market with many stalls (wide DAG). This holds even under the unreasonable assumption that prices remain fixed over time, due to the latency of price discovery (or dually, the latency of "correcting" for a crazy seller). A totally unnecessary association is Birkhoff's ergodic theorem asserting equality between space-average and time-average (w.r.t any measure-preserving endo), except space-average is more natural and discovered faster in our context. Going back to reality, where prices change often, sequential monopolies are even worse. I think this jusifies wide DAGs for the oracle problem.

For MEV I want to outline my "noise" direction, which merely obstructs MEV, vs Yoni's beautiful reverse auctions, which actually improves economic efficiency (and life) for both operators and users.
1. (Noise) When ordering causally independent blocks, the protocol should mix the transactions between them. Mixing obstructs MEV since operators cannot even _locally_ control ordering: their proposed blocks are not pasted "as-is" into the ledger. The wider the DAG, the more obstructive the noise becomes. This approach can be adapted to chains at the cost of latency.
2. (Reverse auctions / bilateral market) In a nutshell, if several operators wish to include a given user transaction, they can compete in an auction where each bid signifies the "kickback" offered from the operator to the user. Thus we have a beautiful duality: on one hand operators auction-off ledger space, but on the other hand users auction-off their transactions. This approach too can be adapted to chains at the cost of latency.

Whatever you prefer, wide DAGs are crucial for social integrity.

### Computational integrity

TODO

[^1]: Common belief in the context of modal logic.
[^2]: It is customary to disregard the distinction between network operators (creators of blocks/votes) and other nodes that can only manipulate the propagation of messages. In practice this distinction is important.
[^3]: One may think of causal independence in a DAG as the correct generalization of simultaneity (beautifully eradicated by Einstein).
[^4]: I like the term "revelation principle" used by Yoni and Sutton.
[^5]: Protocols often use two voting rounds to finalize. The second round ensures safety during asynchrony by preventing secret quorums. Intuitively, it does so by bringing the network a step closer to common knowledge - a secondary quorum must know about a preliminary one.
[^6]: There are some caveats here for naive protocols e.g. uncle blocks.
[^7]: The "original" says "integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching". I have seen it misattributed to C.S Lewis, maybe due to the thematic resonance with his apologist views. At any rate, in our field I hope _everyone_ is watching all the time - the whole is to avoid _hoping_ for integrity.
[^8]: UTXOs have built-in ordering by their very native as "directed envelopes". In Ethereum, each user controls the ordering on its transactions using sequence numbers, known in the Ethereum ecosystem as account nonces. Furthermore, there is literature on fair-ordering protocols that impose causality relations on the ledger.
[^9]: We could and probably should have used exchange rates and not prices, but the passage to cardinals somehow simplifies the subsequent bit about common knowledge in my opinion.
