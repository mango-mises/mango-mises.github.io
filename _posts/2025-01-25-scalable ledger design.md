## Sequencing, execution, statements

Todos:

1. Only network integrity requires decentralization.
2. Consensus on execution is a middle-ground: it gives a concrete statement (e.g. state-diffs) for consumption to those who trust consensus.
3. Ideally every execution is a one-time event, without everyone else verifying.
4. Compare consensus on ordering vs consensus on ordering & verification.
